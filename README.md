<h1>Aster Information</h1>

This is a fully responsive website built as a freelance project for a potential client. The project was initiated based on an agreement to deliver a professional, user-friendly, and responsive website. The development process focused on creating an interactive user experience and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

The primary goal of the project was to design and develop a clean, modern website that would reflect the client's brand identity and meet their business needs. The website includes animations, and dynamic interactions, and supports multiple screen sizes for an optimal experience across different devices.

Initially, the project was developed under a freelance agreement. However, due to a difference in pricing expectations, the project agreement was not finalized. Despite the cancellation of the agreement, the website was completed as a demonstration of my skills in front-end development.
